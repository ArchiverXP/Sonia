# Sonia
An API extension for iOS 6! WIP.


WARNING: THIS IS MORE SO A POC, THIS API EXTENSION IS VERY UNSTABLE!!!!


Compatibility list:
RedBall 4: Gets ingame, but after the first cutscene, crashes due to a compiler symbol error. (___sincosf_stret) also is really unstable.



HOW TO USE:

Patch your IPA with the SoniaLegacyPatch.sh file, supply both the ipa file and the name, you may have to put in your unzipped Payload from the ipa.

Use Theos to compile.

NOTE: THIS IS MAC ONLY!! This is because of install_name_tool.
